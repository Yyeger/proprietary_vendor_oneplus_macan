Vendor Tree for Oneplus Macan

This Vendor tree comes from the Chinese OTA of the Oneplus Ace 6T. I hade to fix a bunch of conflicts to make it run but this version of the vendor tree with the device tree on my profile succesfully passes the "m nothing" command in the lineage OS build environement.

I'm build the first rom right now, It's definetly going to fail but this is something.
